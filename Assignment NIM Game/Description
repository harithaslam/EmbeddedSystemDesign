The Assignment is to design a flow chart of NIM game Arduino based.

The Nim is a game with 12 balls, If is your turn you can pick 1,2 or 3 balls and then your opponent plays. The winner is the one who takes the last one.]

Using Arduino, we set up two controller where each have 2 button. First, the Play Button is to turn down the ball. It can be done up to three times. Then,
either the play want to press Button Next after one ball turn down, or 3 balls (max), the second player will do his/her turn doing the same thing.
The player that is doing the game with the last ball turn down is the winner
